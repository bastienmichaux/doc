software quality control (sqc)

set of activities for ensuring quality

but is limited to the review testing phases of the SDLC

while SQA is oriented towards prevention, SQC is oriented towards prevention

goal is to ensure that the products meet specifications/requirements during this phase

activities:
* requirement review
* design review
* code review
* deployment plan review
* test plan review
* test cases review

testing:
* unit testing
* integration testing
* system testing
* acceptance testing

software testing life cycle:
1. requirements / design review : deliver "review defect" reports
1. test planning : deliver test plan, test estimation, test schedule
1. test design : deliver test cases, test scripts, test data, requirements traceability matrix
1. test implementation
1. test environment setup : deliver test environment
1. test execution : deliver test results (incremental), bug reports
1. test reporting : deliver test results (final), test metrics, test closure report
