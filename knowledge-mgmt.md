systematic mgmt of an organization's knowledge assets

KM is initiatives, processes, strategies & systems that sustain & enhance the storage, assessment, sharing, refinement & creation of knowledge

each org should define KM in terms of its own business objectives

KM is all about applying knowledge in new, previously overburdened or novel situations

## KM is a continuous cycle

3 processes:
- creation & improvement
- distribution & circulation
- addition & application

a cycle of transforming
- insights
- understandings
- practical know-how
into
- books
- technology
- practices
- traditions

information is changed into actionable knowledge & made available effortlessly in a usable form to the people who can leverage it according to their needs

goals:
- ensure full utilization of the org's knowledge base
- pair the potential of everyone's skills & ideas to create a more efficient & effective company
- creating value & meeting tactical & strategic requirements

## why KM ?

- globalization of business: share info between teams, sites, make it available in different languages & jargon
- leaner org: orgs focus on key processes to increase customer value. Ultimate goal: provide perfect value to the custome through a perfect value creation process that has zero waste
- corporate amnesia: knowledge continuity isn't ensured when people leave the organization. organizations have continuous learning demands
- technological advances: have changed customer expectations: they expect quick, accurate info

but also: handle a complex, information-overloaded work env
